# Tube's Zigbee Gateways
Information and Documentation on Tube's Zigbee Gateways

Tube's Zigbee Gateways are serial over ethernet zigbee gateways for use with any project that can access a remote serial device. The gateway is made up of a WT32-ETH01 module which is an ESP32 with ethernet and either a CC2652p Zigbee Module or an EFR32 based Zigbee module.

## Getting up and Running
1. Connect the gateway to a ethernet cable which has access you your local network.
2. Power on the gateway with a micro usb cable and power supply.
3. Determine the device's ip address
    If your local network supports .local mdns addresses, the devices can be reached that way:
    -for CC2652p based gatways: tube_zb_gw_cc2652p2.local
    -for EFR32 based gateways: tube_zb_gw_efr32.local
   
    **If using an IP Address besure it is reserved in your router so it does not change**
    
4. Configure your software to access the device.

    *For CC2652p based gateways select ZNP*  
    *For EFR32 based gateways select EZSP*

    For the Specifying the Port Specific Settings: Enter socket://ip_or_localdns_name:6638

    **CC2652p Based example:**

    **For Zigbee2mqtt - Only the CC2652p based gateway is supported at this time:**

    in the Zigbee2MQTT `configuration.yaml` 

    ```
    serial:
      port: 'tcp://tube_zb_gw_cc2652p2.local:6638'

    ```
