# Tube's Zigbee Gateways
Information and Documentation on Tube's Zigbee Gateways

Tube's Zigbee Gateways are serial over ethernet zigbee gateways for use with any project that can access a remote serial device. The gateway is made up of a WT32-ETH01 module which is an ESP32 with ethernet and either a CC2652p Zigbee Module or an EFR32 based Zigbee module.

## Getting up and Running
1. Connect the gateway to a ethernet cable which has access you your local network.
2. Power on the gateway with a micro usb cable and power supply.
3. Determine the device's ip address
    If your local network supports .local mdns addresses, the devices can be reached that way:
    -for CC2652p based gatways: tube_zb_gw_cc2652p2.local
    -for EFR32 based gateways: tube_zb_gw_efr32.local
   
    **If using an IP Address besure it is reserved in your router so it does not change**
    
4. Configure your software to access the device.
